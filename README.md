# angular-redux2/store

Angular-redux2/store is a powerful library for building Angular applications with Redux.
Redux is a state management pattern that has become very popular in the JavaScript community for its simplicity and predictability.
It provides a single source of truth for your application's state and uses a unidirectional data flow to manage data changes.

Angular-redux2/store builds upon Redux to provide seamless integration with Angular.
It provides a set of services and decorators that make it easy to manage your application's state and bind it to your Angular components.

In the near future, our support will be extended to include backwards compatibility with `RxJS` version `7.5.0`,
and support for `Angular` versions `12` and `13`, while continuing to support `Redux` version `4.2.1`.

## Changes from @angular-redux/store

Please note that function names have been changed in this version of the library (as it is a new codebase).
You'll need to adjust accordingly when using it, e.g. select => Select,
with substore => Substore, dispatch => Dispatch etc.
